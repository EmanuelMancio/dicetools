# DICEtools
Repository of selected Python 3 scripts used to aid data analysis and input generation of Monte Carlo and Configurational Bias Monte Carlo simulations performed with Dice.


## Dependencies
To use the script a few Python 3 dependencies are needed, namely
- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [OpenBabel](http://openbabel.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You can install these dependencies in any way you want, however, we encourage the use of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Python distribution.
To install the libraries with Anaconda, do the following:
```
conda install numpy
conda install -c openbabel openbabel
conda install matplotlib
```

## Short description of tools
All the scripts can be run with the `-h` option to show a brief description of what the script does and the mandatory and optional parameters.
